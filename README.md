# Stadium Event Page for the Washington Commanders - Coding Temple Project 

## Project Introduction: 
* Part one: Recreate a website that you like using bootstrap
* Part two: Wrote JavaScript functions to simulate features I'd like to implement in the futureâ€”without integrating them into the site currently.

## Website Description
This website depicts the schedule for the washington commanders home games, its food stand menu, and a contact form to reach out to the stadium (along with FAQs)

## How the website is structures
* The first page has a hero section using bootstrap carousel code and then a bootstrap card code to display all home games
* There is a part in the bottom of the page where there is a button for a random game selector. Though it may not work currently, the script.js code has the function for furture integration
* The 2nd page is the menu section where it tells you the food provided, the price, where it is located (what level of the stadium), and if its in stock currently.
* The last page is the contact and FAQ page. This is validated using bootstrap "needs-validation" class.

## JavaScript code
* Script.js has 4 functions where feastures can be implemented in the future: validating emails, storing the feedback, an alert pop up, and random game picker
* validating email: This will make sure your email has an "@" symbol AND a "."
* storing feedback: the feedback in the contact form will be stored for future use
* This pop up will say "Thanks for checking out the food menu", just a fun little pop up
* The random game picker, will pick a random game for you to go too! 

# Bootstrap
* The main tool used for this website is bootstrap so the website is responsive no matter the screen size.
